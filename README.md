Desprection
The task is to create as many PacMan as you want when you click the button. The PacMan you create will start moving at random velocity, and when they reach the edge of the screen, it will change position to stay within the frame of the webpage.

Here's how the game is played:

Each time the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pac man created should start moving at random velocity on the screen
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page
